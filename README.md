# OBS-Controller

Recently I started to join more streams during the 2020 pandemic. Not streaming myself but joining (with camera) via Discord. 

To control my video output I use OBS and virtualcam to output video to discord.

Since I want to make my life as easy as possible I created a small box to help me switch scenes and control my microphone.

Main source code can be found here: [main.cpp](src/main.cpp)

### Some overview images:

**Updated the box to have a footswitch and a USB-B connector to relief cable stress on the Arduino**
